## Description
In this repository, I've created MyAnimeList-Styled, my creative take on enhancing the user experience of the popular MyAnimeList platform. With a fresh and modern design, this project leverages the power of Next.js, React, and the Fetch API to provide you with a seamless and visually appealing anime tracking experience. Thanks for [JikanAPI](https://jikan.moe/) for providing these awesome API.
